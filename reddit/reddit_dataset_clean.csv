They pretended to be a girl in college a year older than me. To me it was pretty obvious it was heading down this path, so I texted my friends about it and we decided to play it out so I can raise awareness about it. The  first thing they started was small talk, they sent FAKE pictures of themselves (Always reverse image search profile pictures and pictures they sent). Soon after they were asking for pictures of me. For research purposes (DONT DO THIS) I sent an old picture of me in my hotel room on my birthday. Soon after they wanted to partake in what they called ""Sexy Games"" Which they explained as sending nude images back and forth. I said I was down as long as they sent first so I can see what they look like and reverse image search. They sent an image of the only fans girl nude obviously. At this moment I knew they wanted images of me to send to people I knew (They kept asking for it) So I sent a mirror picture I recently posted on my snapchat (DONT DO THIS). They then sent another video of the only fans girl and at this point I started telling them off. I went into detail about how I knew they would put me in a group chat and send any pictures I sent to people I knew if I didn't send money. They persistently denied it over and over again. BUT I WANTED TO BE FOR SURE. So I looked up a random picture on the internet and sent them the picture claiming it was my Johnson (They didn't believe me at first). After I told them over and over again it was me and I promised it was me they sent the exact message I predicted they would. From this point I was in a group chat will all the same friends I was just  plotting this with and random news channels for some reason, and they were threating me in my dms to send the picture I took in the mirror on snap chat mixed in with the nude photo I found off the web. I re dmd them mad ash explaining how that wasn't even my photo and they were still threating to send it to people and lie about it being mine. THEY WILL ALWAYS SAY BLOCKING THEM MAKES IT WORSE, DONT BELEIVE THEM. The moment I blocked them, the people that were in the group chat called me and told me they deleted it without sending anything. ALWAYS BLOCK THEM AND TAKE DOWN YOUR SOCIALS. It has been about 5-6 hours from when the incident occurred and I have yet to get anything sent to me or any of my friends, and I HAVE NOT taken down any of my socials, so taking down your socials would be an even better sense of security.

They then sent another video of the only fans girl and at this point I started telling them off. I went into detail about how I knew they would put me in a group chat and send any pictures I sent to people I knew if I didn't send money. They persistently denied it over and over again. BUT I WANTED TO BE FOR SURE. So I looked up a random picture on the internet and sent them the picture claiming it was my Johnson (They didn't believe me at first). After I told them over and over again it was me and I promised it was me they sent the exact message I predicted they would. From this point I was in a group chat will all the same friends I was just  plotting this with and random news channels for some reason, and they were threating me in my dms to send the picture I took in the mirror on snap chat mixed in with the nude photo I found off the web. I re dmd them mad ash explaining how that wasn't even my photo and they were still threating to send it to people and lie about it being mine. THEY WILL ALWAYS SAY BLOCKING THEM MAKES IT WORSE, DONT BELEIVE THEM. The moment I blocked them, the people that were in the group chat called me and told me they deleted it without sending anything. ALWAYS BLOCK THEM AND TAKE DOWN YOUR SOCIALS. It has been about 5-6 hours from when the incident occurred and I have yet to get anything sent to me or any of my friends, and I HAVE NOT taken down any of my socials, so taking down your socials would be an even better sense of security. Stay safe out there and re read this the next time someone random dms you!!!"
