Hello. ""3 am"" The time of mysticism, isn't it?

All your files are mysteriously encrypted, and the systems ""show no signs of life"", the backups disappeared. But we can correct this very quickly and return all your files and operation of the systems to original state.

All your attempts to restore data by himself will definitely lead to their damage and the impossibility of recovery. We are not recommended to you to do it on our own!!! (or do at your own peril and risk).


There is another important point: we stole a fairly large amount of sensitive data from your local network: financial documents; personal information of your employees, customers, partners; work documentation, postal correspondence and much more.

We prefer to keep it secret, we have no goal to destroy your business. Therefore can be no leakage on our part.

We propose to reach an agreement and conclude a deal.


Otherwise, your data will be sold to darknet. One can only guess how they will be used.

Please contact us as soon as possible, using Tor-browser:

   4) We are open to negotiations.
   5) We are ready to maintain complete confidentiality of this incident.

Let's explain the further steps in the situation:

    You can seek help from authorities - unfortunately, this path will not lead to a constructive resolution of the situation. 
        They will not assist you with decryption, seize your servers for OPsec, and your company's operations will be halted.
        Subsequently, the date will be disclosed, leading to fines, legal actions, and reputational damage.
    OR
    You initiate negotiations with us, and we reach a mutually beneficial and constructive solution for both parties.
        You pay a specified amount and receive the full decryption, support throughout the decryption process, 
        proofs that all information on our servers has been deleted, and a guarantee that it will never resurface, 
        ensuring no one learns about this incident.

To initiate negotiations, please download the Tor Browser using their official website: https://www.torproject.org/

Just focus on negotiations, payment and decryption to make all of your problems solved by our specialists within 1 day after payment received: servers and data restored, everything will work good as new."

Akira,akira_readme.txt,https://www.ransomware.live/ransomnote/akira/akira_readme.txt,"Hi friends,



Whatever who you are and what your title is if you're reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead, all your backups - virtual, physical - everything that we managed to reach - are completely removed. Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your corporate data prior to encryption.



Well, for now let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue. We're fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources. At the moment, you have to know:



1. Dealing with us you will save A LOT due to we are not interested in ruining your financially. We will study in depth your finance, bank & income statements, your savings, investments etc. and present our reasonable demand to you. If you have an active cyber insurance, let us know and we will guide you how to properly use it. Also, dragging out the negotiation process will lead to failing of a deal.

2. Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. Our decryptor works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service from the beginning of our conversation. If you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them - in this case we won't be able to help.

3. The security report or the exclusive first-hand information that you will receive upon reaching an agreement is of a great value, since NO full audit of your network will show you the vulnerabilities that we've managed to detect and used in order to get into, identify backup solutions and upload your data.

4. As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. Then all of this will be published in our blog - https://akiral2iz6a7qgd3ayp3l6yub7xx2uep76idk3u2kollpj5z3z636bad.onion.

5. We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which will satisfy both of us.



If you're indeed interested in our assistance and the services we provide you can reach out to us following simple instructions:



1. Install TOR Browser to get access to our chat room - https://www.torproject.org/download/.

2. Paste this link - https://akiralkzxzq2dsrzsrvbr2xgbbu2wgsmxryd4csgfameg52n7efvr2id.onion.

Your network is hacked and files are encrypted.
	Including the encrypted data we also downloaded other confidential information:
	Data of your employees, customers, partners, as well as accounting and
	other internal documentation of your company.

		purchases in online stores.
	2) You may be sued by clients of your company for leaking information that was confidential.
	3) After other hackers obtain personal data about your employees, social engineering will be
		applied to your company and subsequent attacks will only intensify.
	4) Bank details and passports can be used to create bank accounts and online wallets through 
		which criminal money will be laundered.
	5) You will forever lose the reputation.

Please include your **Company Name** and **Device ID** in your first message.


🔒 [ TEST DECRYPTION OFFER ]

To prove we can restore your files, we offer free decryption of:
	- 1 document file (under 1MB)
	- 1 image file (under 5MB)


🚫 [ DO NOT TRUST UNVERIFIED “RECOVERY EXPERTS” ]

You may try to recover your data on your own or with a security firm. However, we strongly advise against involving third parties who are not officially trusted by you.

Do not share your device ID with untrusted third parties. The device ID is an identifier that proves that you are a victim.

Some so-called “recovery experts” will ask for your Device ID. They will then contact us pretending to be you, get a test decryption from us, and act like they did it themselves. They’ll show you the decrypted file, make you believe they can recover everything, and take your money.

In the end, they disappear. You lose time, money, and trust.

Your Device ID means nothing to them technically — but it helps them fool you.

We are the only ones with the keys. Don’t waste your time or budget chasing illusions.


⚠️ [ DO NOT ATTEMPT DIY DECRYPTION ]

You are free to try recovery attempts with your own tools or with trusted providers.  
But we strongly recommend that you **create backups first**.

If you damage or overwrite any encrypted files, not even we can restore them.

No tool, no expert, and no government can break our encryption without the key.


✅ [ WHY CHOOSE US ]

We are professionals.  
If anyone else or any organization claims to be able to decrypt it, it is a scam.
The strength of the encryption makes it impossible for anyone other than us to decrypt it.

The sooner you contact us, the lower the cost — and the faster your business can get back on track.

**We are the only ones who can actually solve this.**

Act quickly. Every hour counts.
Contact us now to begin the recovery. Time is running out."

We’re sorry to inform you that we’ve had to hack [snip] network completely and transfer “all” data to our secure servers.
So, keep calm, take a breath and think about an apartheid regime that causes troubles here and there.
They should pay for their lies and crimes, their names and shames. They should pay for occupation, war crimes against humanity,
killing the people (not only Palestinians’ bodies, but also Israelis’ souls) and destroying the future and all dreams we had.
They should pay for firing high-skilled experts.

Anyway, there is nothing for you (as an individual) to be worried.
That’s the task of the administration to follow up our instruction for recovering the network.
But, you can contact us via TOX messenger if you want to recover your files personally. (TOX ID: AB33BC51AFAC64D98226826E70B483593C81CB22E6A3B504F7A75348C38C862F00042F5245AC)

Our instruction for the administration:
All your files are encrypted using AES-256 military grade algorithm. So,
	1. Don't try to recover data, because the encrypted files are unrecoverable unless you have the key.
	Any try for recovering data without the key (using third-party applications/companies) causes PERMANENT damage. Take it serious.
	2. You have to trust us. This is our business (after firing from high-tech companies) and the reputation is all we have.
	3. All you need to do is following up the payment procedure and then you will receive decrypting key using for returning all of your files and VMs.
	4. Payment method:
		Enter the link below
			http://iw6v2p3cruy7tqfup3yl4dgt4pfibfa3ai4zgnu5df2q3hus3lm7c7ad.onion/support
		Enter the ID below and pay the bill (80 BTC)
			[snip]
You will receive decrypting key after the payment.

Notice that you just have 48 hours. After the deadline, a 30% penalty will be added to the price.
We put data for sale after 5 days.
Take it serious and don’t listen to probable advices of a stupid government.

Good Luck!

All your confidential information about all employees and all partners and developments has been downloaded to our servers and is located with us.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Our team has an extensive background in legal and so called white hat hacking.
However, clients usually considered the found vulnerabilities to be minor and poorlyr\n
paid for our services.
So we decided to change our business model. Now you understand how important it isr\n

to allocate a good budget for IT security.
This is serious business for us and we really don't want to ruin your privacy,r\n
reputation and a company.
We just want to get paid for our work whist finding vulnerabilities in various networks.

Your files are currently encrypted with our tailor made state of the art algorithm.

all this can lead to partial or complete data loss.

We have also managed to download a large amount of various, crucial data from your network.
A complete list of files and samples will be provided upon request.

We can decrypt a couple of files for free. The size of each file must be no more than 5 megabytes.

All your data will be successfully decrypted immediately after your payment.
You will also receive a detailed list of vulnerabilities used to gain access to your network.
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

If you refuse to cooperate with us, it will lead to the following consequences for your company:

Attention! 

All your files, documents, photos, databases and other important files are encrypted and have the extension: .KRAB 

The only method of recovering files is to purchase an unique private key. Only we can give you this key and only we can recover your files.


The server with your key is in a closed network TOR. You can get there by the following ways:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| 0. Download Tor browser - https://www.torproject.org/ 

| 1. Install Tor browser 
| 2. Open Tor Browser 
| 3. Open link in TOR browser:   http://gandcrabmfe6mnef.onion/[snip]                        
| 4. Follow the instructions on this page 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    
    

On our page you will see instructions on payment and get the opportunity to decrypt 1 file for free. 


ATTENTION!

IN ORDER TO PREVENT DATA DAMAGE:

* DO NOT MODIFY ENCRYPTED FILES
* DO NOT CHANGE DATA BELOW

---BEGIN GANDCRAB KEY---
[snip]
---END GANDCRAB KEY---

---BEGIN PC DATA---
[snip]
---END PC DATA---"
Global,README_Global.txt,https://www.ransomware.live/ransomnote/global/README_Global.txt,"GLOBAL

Your network has been encrypted.

All of your important files — documents, databases, backups, and configurations are now inaccessible. 
They have been locked using military-grade encryption. Only GLOBAL holds the decryption keys.

What happened?
-------------------------
We have gained full access to your internal network. During this time, sensitive data was exfiltrated 
and your systems were encrypted.

Your business operations, internal communications, and customer data are at risk.

What comes next?
-------------------------
To restore access:
1. Download the Tor Browser (https://www.torproject.org/)
2. Visit our secure portal: gdbkvfe6g3whrzkdlbytksygk45zwgmnzh5i2xmqyo3mrpipysjagqyd.onion/chat/[snip]
3. Enter your unique ID: [snip]
4. Follow the instructions to begin negotiations.

You may submit one small file (<1MB, non-sensitive) for free decryption as proof we hold the keys.
We will also send you a file-listing to prove to you that we have stolen your data.

Failure to engage within 3 days will result in:
- Public release of your internal documents
- Irreversible loss of your encrypted data
- Escalation of your case to a wider leak network

There is no other way. Do not waste time with third-party tools or law enforcement. 
You will only make things worse.

This is not personal. Just business.

Gwisinlocker,gwisinlocker.txt,https://www.ransomware.live/ransomnote/gwisinlocker/gwisinlocker.txt,"Hello [snip],
You have been visited by GWISIN.
We have exfiltrated a lot of sensitive data from your networks, including, but not limited to:

I. Production applications, source (Git/SVN), files and DBs
[1] LIMS (all regions) + DNA and other internal platforms

By combining lab (LIMS) data and the primary big customer platform (DNA), it is easy to identify customer projects, credentials and data.
Despite ISO27001 and ISMS-P with a good PIMS strategy, you have failed to protect customer data across all services.
Your privacy policy assures customers their data security and privacy is top priority, reality seems very different. 
We wonder what your customers will have to say about that?

[2] My-genomestory (MGS), myPETGENE and general DTC related data

Once again failing to protect very sensitive data and communications of your customers.

[3] Infrastructure and sequencing pipeline data / scripts 

Everything from documentation to project specs to produced VCFs and PDF reports post-analysis were collected. 
More importantly, a full deep dive of your network infrastructure documentation and access.
The only way to kick us out is to buy all new hardware, including network equipment (UTM / switches) and sequencing / data storage systems.  
Someone could have quietly modified your sequencing pipeline instead of contacting you, causing you much bigger issues (legal, financial and otherwise). 
Can you really trust your results, if you can't trust your input data and processing pipelines?

II. Internal Data & Communications

[1] ERP/CRM Systems (NEOE, Dynamics)
[2] Active Directory dump with credential history (NTDS + passive credential collection)
[3] DO GW with DB (your groupware contains a lot of data)
[4] Exchange email communications (PST) of targeted important employees in various roles
[5] Financial / Accounting / Research / IT / Customer / Etc. documents

- A lot of documents and other files were collected from SHARE/NEWSHARE machines among other servers
- Your DLP and monitoring was rendered effectively useless and could not stop us, neither could your security team and defensive products

We have also encrypted critical Windows and Linux servers.
We recommend that you do NOT restart servers or recovery may be slower.
The good news for you is that we can:
- Decrypt all files with extension "".[victim_snip]"" very quickly
- Delete all sensitive data we have exfiltrated, instead of selling it
- Help you improve your security
- Disappear and not be your problem anymore

All you have to do is follow the instructions:
1.) Download Tor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2.) Go to our website: http://[snip]:[snip]@gwisin4yznpdtzq424i3la6oqy5evublod4zbhddzuxcnr34kgfokwad.onion
3.) Login with username: [snip], password: [snip]
4.) Change password (one time setup)
5.) Setup end-to-end message encryption password
6.) Read the full instructions on the website and contact us using the message system provided there

[WARNING - #1] 
If you are having trouble reaching our website, attempt closing and re-opening the Tor browser. 
If you are still unable to reach our website, create a DNS TXT record @ [victim_subdomain].[victim_domain].com containing a hex-encoded email address and we will contact you.
However, eventually we will need to communicate using our website to preserve the privacy of all parties involved. 

[WARNING - #2]
Do NOT contact law enforcement (such as NPA, KISA or SMPA) or threat intelligence organizations as they may prevent you from recovering quickly.
They can't really help you and they don't care if your business is destroyed in the process.
Contact us within 72 working hours, so we can negotiate in good faith and resolve this quickly."

Welcome, this is karakurt team.

=====================================================================
PLEASE READ THIS SO YOU CAN CONTACT US!
=====================================================================

Ok, you are reading this - so it means that we have your attention. 
Here's the deal :
1. We breached your internal network and took control over all of your systems.
2. We analyzed and located each piece of more-or-less important files while spending weeks inside.
3. We exfiltrated anything we wanted (the total size of taken data exeeds !200GB!).

You can see the full file-tree of downloaded files near to our note. (file-tree.zip)

You can choose any two files from file-tree and we will provide them to you in confirmation that we have them.

Also, if necessary, we can return your files back after payment.

FAQ:
- Who the hell are you?
- Pretty skilled hackers I guess.

- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!?? 
- Our motivation is purely financial.

- We are going to report this to law enforcement.
- You surely can, but be ready that they will confiscate most of your IT infrastructure, and even if you will later change your mind and decide to pay - they will not let you.

- Who else already knows about the breach?
- Me, You, Nobody else. For now.

- What if I tell you that I do not care and going to ignore this incident.
- That's a very bad choice. If you will not contact us in a timely manner we will start notifying your employees, clients, partners, subcontractors and any other persons that should know how you treat your own corporate secrets and theirs.

- What if I will not contact you even after it?
- Than we shall move forward and start contacting your business competitors and list of anonymous inside traders we deal with, to find out if they are going to pay us for your data. When the list of the people who is interested in such data is formed - the closed online auction starts.

- Noone will buy what you took! I do not believe you!
- If the auction fails - we will just leak everything online, making sure that this leak goes straight to the press. We will make sure that your business will bleed by using any power we have in our posession, both social and technical.

- What happens if I pay?
- Nothing bad will happen. 
	We will remove everything we took from your network and leave you be.
	We will provide the confirmation that the data is deleted.
	We will help you to close technical vulnerabilities you have and provide some insight on how to avoid such incidents if some other perpetrator is interested in you.
	We will never tell anybody about it.

- We understand. We are ready to move forward.
- You will find the Access Code at the end of this file, you will need this one to get in contact with us for further instructions.

All logs are completely removed So you don't even know how you got hacked But don't worry, we will also provide you with a complete security report

[+] Warnings!
Do not go to recovery companies, they are just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you.
They secretly negotiate with us, buy decryption software and will sell it to you many times more expensive or they will simply scam you.
In order to create a public decryption, the executable file of the virus needs to be available to reverse engineering experts, but since the program has the ability to self-destruct, so far no public file has been placed on the Internet So any claim of decryption by individuals is a scam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] Very important! For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks.
Insurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret, this is to never pay the maximum amount specified in the contract or to pay nothing at all, disrupting negotiations.
The insurance company will try to derail negotiations in any way they can so that they can later argue that you will be denied coverage because your insurance does not cover the ransom amount.
For example your company is insured for 10 million dollars, while negotiating with your insurance agent about the ransom he will offer us the lowest possible amount, for example 100 thousand dollars, we will refuse the paltry amount and ask for example the amount of 15 million dollars, the insurance agent will never offer us the top threshold of your insurance of 10 million dollars.
He will do anything to derail negotiations and refuse to pay us out completely and leave you alone with your problem. If you told us anonymously that your company was insured for $10 million and other important details regarding insurance coverage"

Dear management,
If you are reading this message, it means that:

-------------------------------------
                    1. THE FOLLOWING IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
1.1 EDITING FILES ON HDD. 	
                       Renaming, copying or moving any files 
                       could DAMAGE the cipher and 
                       decryption will be impossible. 
1.2 USING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. 
                       Trying to recover with any software 
                       can also break the cipher and 
                       file recovery will become a problem.
1.3 SHUTDOWN OR RESTART THE PC. 
                       Boot and recovery errors can also damage the cipher. 
                       Sorry about that, but doing so is entirely at your own risk.
-------------------------------------
            2. EXPLANATION OF THE SITUATION
2.1 HOW DID THIS HAPPEN
The security of your IT perimeter has been compromised (it's not perfect at all). 
We encrypted your workstations and servers to make the fact of the intrusion visible and to prevent you from hiding critical data leaks.
We spent a lot of time researching and finding out the most important directories of your business, your weak points. 
We have already downloaded a huge amount of critical data and analyzed it. Now its fate is up to you, it will either be deleted or sold, or shared with the media.
2.2 VALUABLE DATA WE USUALLY STEAL:
            - Databases, legal documents, personal information.
            - Audit reports.
            - Any financial documents (Statements, invoices, accounting, transfers,e-mails, etc.).
            - Work files and corporate correspondence.
            - Any backups.
	    - Confidential documents.
2.3 TO DO LIST (best practies)
            - Contact us as soon as possible.
            - Contact us only in our live chat, otherwise you can run into scammers.
            - Purchase our decryption tool and decrypt your files. There is no other way to do this.
            - Realize that dealing with us is the shortest way to success and secrecy.
            - Give up the idea of using decryption help programs, otherwise you will destroy the system permanently.
            - Avoid any third-party negotiators and recovery groups. They can become the source of leaks.
-------------------------------------
            3. POSSIBLE DECISIONS
3.1 NOT MAKING THE DEAL
            - After 5 days starting tomorrow your leaked data will be Disclosed or sold.
            - We will also send the data to all interested supervisory organizations and the media.
            - Decryption key will be deleted permanently and recovery will be impossible.
            - Losses from the situation can be measured based on your annual budget.
3.2 MAKING THE WIN-WIN DEAL
            - You will get the only working Decryption Tool and the how-to-use Manual. 
            - You will get our guarantees (with log provided) of non-recovarable deletion of all your leaked data.
            - You will get our guarantees of secrecy and removal of all traces related to the deal in the Internet. 
            - You will get our security report on how to fix your security breaches.
Another important fact to note here: after the deal is made, it would take only 4-6 hours to restore your infrastructure.

Hi dears! This is TommyLeaks team and it is pleasure for us to inform you that your company network has been breached. We have stolen your files and documents and exfiltrated only the most sensitive and useful information from that.

First of all, remain calm and do not undertake any hasty actions at that moment if you want to save your reputation and avoid any bad scenarios:
- do not go to the authorities. They will perhaps confiscate your PCs and other IT equipment and will not prevent the process of your data leaking (hundred percent);
- do not contact any recovery agencies. They will just make money from your incident and of course try to cheat you. You will not save money at this case. It is better and cheaper for you to communicate with us on your own.

We're here not to rob you and won't be trying to intimidate you, we're just interested in helping you to rebuild your security infrastructure and be safe further. But of course our services cost money. How much? Will be known once we check your finance. We aren't going to ask for too much, so please do not try to bargain with us with no worthy arguments. Remember that all your files are in front of us.

As for the guarantees, we are committed to provide you with deletion log, breach report and other necessary materials once we receive the payment. We work for reputation and do not want some victim to spread any bad gossips about us or something, so be sure that the deal will be clean and honest. We guarantee that we will not attack your network again after payment but we will return in case deal falling through.

Once you are ready to move to the payment stage, there are some recommendations on how to do this securely:
- if you go to the bank to take a loan or just withdraw your funds, tell the bank that you need this money for the investment purposes only;
- if you have some troubles gaining bitcoins, just go to any exchange platform (coinbase.com, for instance) or a local broker to buy BTC from them for cash. That way no authorities or researchers do not trace your bank transfers. You may also go to the third party person who may make a transfer instead of you. 

So, that's it. And finally to contact us use this link - https://xir242nunyist4d7ksfnfmhnjx4gvqbuzo7eax4o3abqjesbxjshh4qd.onion/
You have to open the link only in TOR Browser (download it here: https://www.torproject.org). Then insert your password - [snip] - inside the field on the page and we will be able to communicate securely.

Please do not waste time because now it plays againts you.

In addition to encrypting all your systems, deleting backups, we also downloaded 2 terabytes of confidential information.

Here's what you shouldn't do:

1) Contact the police, fbi or other authorities before the end of our deal

2) Contact the recovery company so that they would conduct dialogues with us. (This can slow down the recovery, and generally put our communication to naught)

3) Do not try to decrypt the files yourself, as well as do not change the file extension yourself !!! This can lead to the impossibility of their decryption.

4) Keep us for fools)

We will also stop any communication with you, and continue DDoS, calls to employees and business partners. 

In a few weeks, we will simply repeat our attack and delete all your data from your networks, WHICH WILL LEAD TO THEIR UNAVAILABILITY!

Here's what you should do right after reading it:

1) If you are an ordinary employee, send our message to the CEO of the company, as well as to the IT department

2) If you are a CEO, or a specialist in the IT department, or another person who has weight in the company, you should contact us within 24 hours by email.
